## A little about myself - The author

I am an explorer and a researcher through and through. I am trained as a Federalist. I work as an AI scientist. I like to know, read, and wander. This is a compilation of what I feel and think, but most of the time I fail to word my thoughts, or the words fail me. I find most solace in fantasy, folklore, myths, and poems.
